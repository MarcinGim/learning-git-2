			<h1>Elbow - My Sad Captains</h1>
			<p>Oh, long before<br>
				You and I were born<br>
				Others beat these benches with their empty cups<br>
				To the night and its stars<br>
	      		To be here, and now, and who we are</p>

			<p>Another sunrise with my sad captains<br>
				With who I choose to lose my mind<br>
				And if it's all we only pass this way but once<br>
	        	What a perfect waste of time</p>
			
			<p>The BMX apothecary<br>
				Oh my soul<br>
				The architect of infamy<br>
				Oh my soul<br>
				For each and every train we miss<br>
				Oh my soul<br>
				A bitter little Eucharist<br>
				Oh my soul<br>
				Oh, long before<br>
				You and I were born<br>
				Others beat these benches with their empty cups<br>
				To the night and its stars<br>
	        	To be here, and now, and who we are</p>
