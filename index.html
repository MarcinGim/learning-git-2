		<h1>Elbow - My Sad Captains</h1>
		<p>Oh, long before<br>
			You and I were born<br>
			Others beat these benches with their empty cups<br>
			To the night and its stars<br>
      To be here, and now, and who we are</p>

			<p>Another sunrise with my sad captains<br>
			With who I choose to lose my mind<br>
			And if it's all we only pass this way but once<br>
        What a perfect waste of time</p>
